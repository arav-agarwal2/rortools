To check current compilation status:
`R> devtools::check()`

Currently in need of fixing/removing the following dependencies:
 - glog ( Removable, but may require tons of work )
 - absl ( Macros are interfering with RCpp's base free/alloc macros, causing problems )

Once we get these dependencies removed, we can continue writing code using RCpp and creating the interface functions. However, currently just getting the compilation struggles correctly.
